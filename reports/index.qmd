## How to Use These Reports

These reports are designed to be:

1. **Comprehensive** - Providing both data analysis and strategic interpretation
2. **Visual** - Including animated visualizations that make trends immediately apparent
3. **Actionable** - Focusing on implications rather than just observations

For best results, review the animations in conjunction with the written analysis, and consider how the identified trends might impact your specific objectives.

## Technical Details

All visualizations were created using Python, primarily with matplotlib and pandas. The reports are generated using Quarto, allowing for interactive elements and seamless integration of code, visualizations, and analysis.

For technical details on how the visualizations were created, please refer to the corresponding Python scripts in the main project directory.
